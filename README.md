# CS1400---RouletteGame

A simple roulette betting program in which the user will be prompted to correctly guess a randomly generated number ranging from 1 to 36. They can either guess low, meaning the number is in the range of 1 - 18, high, meaning it's 19 - 36, or try to guess the exact number for a higher return on the bet. The program will display results to the user after determining if they win or lose.
